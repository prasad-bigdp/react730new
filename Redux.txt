Redux: Redux is a Predictable state management library of Javascript. it can be used with react or angular or vue or even vanilla Javascript.
Majority of the times it is used with react

  In small apps, individual component state is enough but when application grows multiple components may need to access same data . For that we need to use Global state logic using Redux

REDUX has three Principles
1.  single source of truth:
      Whole application state is stored in one single object inside a store
    {
        users:{name:"John"},
        cart:[],
        count:0
    }

2. state is Read only :
       You cannot modify the state directly . Instead you dispatch an action describing what happend

3. changes are made with Pure functions(any functions that does change what it receives) :
It uses Pure functions named Reducers that 
     --> Takes current state
     --> Take an action
     --> Return new state

How to do?
  step1: npm install redux react-redux
  step2: create actions,reducer and store
  Actions are function that returns an object which contains type , payload etc.., They basically tells redux what just happened
  export const increment = () => {
	return {
		type: "INCR",
	}
}
export const decrement = () => {
	return {
		type: "DECR",
	}
}

REDUCERS are pure function that accepts state and action and returns a new state. it never modifies exisiting state .
store contains reducers . we can create store using createStore
const initialState = {
    count:0
}
const counterReducer = (state=initialState, action) =>
{
    switch (action.type)
    {
        case "INCR": return { ...state, count:state.count+1}
        case "DECR": return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 }
            default: return state
    }
}
export default counterReducer
store.js:  import { createStore } from 'redux'
import counterReducer from './reducer'
const store = createStore(counterReducer);
export default store;

step4. Provide the store globally using Provider

step5: implement UI with useDipatch and useSelector hooks:
