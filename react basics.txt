1. what is React or react js?
     React is an open source javascript library which is used to build interactive user interfaces(UI -- what you see). React is developed and maintained by meta(facebook)
around 2012 - so many around the globe uses facebook. To make it better experience, they built their own library react and 2014 , they open sourced it.

2. is React js and React Native are same?
React JS is used for web applications/Website. React Native is used for mobile applications

3. what are the major uses of React?
    React is majorily used to build ui  of Single Page Applications (SPA -- an application that loads a specific part of UI instead of whole app) and Progressive Web Apps(PWA -- an application that feels like native app)

4. what are competitors and react advantages over them?
React can be replaced with Angular, Vue.
Angular is a framework of JS and Vue is also a library of JS.
React is more simpler , easy and it supports virtual DOM for quickness

5. Procedure to build first React App.
1. To code React , you need Code Editor. we use VSCode
    First download and install VSCode
2. You need a package manager to install/uninstall/update any packages or libraries. we use npm(node package manager)
    First download nodejs and install
    open cmd and type "npm -v"
    if u get error " npm is not recognized as internal or external command", it is not installed.
3. You need a bundler to get react template bundle. using this, we don't need to create every single file, we will get basic boilerplate code
    npm create vite@latest

4. To Run Application, in terminal , goto specific folder, 
     cd foldername
     npm run dev

5. Goto folder and index.html, 
      change favicon, title
      go to main.jsx and just observe
      goto App.jsx,delete all and write below code

       function App()
         {
            return (
                      <div>
                       <h1>Hello World</h1>
                      </div>
                     )
         }
       export default App;

React  code contains files called jsx(javascript extensible) - using jsx we can write HTML inside Javascript . 
    Every jsx file should return only one html element
    Always name of file and component/function name should be same(better starts with uppercase)
    In JSX, class property should be written as className
    In JSX , it is mandatory to close all tags including self closing tags


For Production, use : npm run build

1. goto website Netlify.com
2. signup using github
3. click new project and deploy manually
4. upload dist folder and to change name, you can use  project configuration

Files & Folders
package.json --  meta data of your project
package-lock.json -- meta data of package.json
vie.config --  settings for vite
eslint -- notifies and observes errors
.gitignore -- contains files that are ignored by git
node_modules --  it contains actual code of all package
public  -- used for public assets
index.html  --  main and entry point of our application. it contains head and body . its body contains an empty div with id "root"
main.jsx -- it loads app.jsx into div with id "root" . in react we call loading as rendering
App.jsx -- contains actual body code in jsx format

React basically Deals with 4 topics
  1. Components
  2. Props
  3.  state and virtual DOM
  4. API's 

1. Components : React divides the whole UI of a website into reusable logical parts called components. They are like legos ,using which we can build applications
    --> Reusable
    ---> simple
    ---> can be functional or class
    ---> return JSX but all jsx files/functions must return only one element

2. Props: props is shortform of properties
// Button.jsx
function Button(props){

return (
        <button style={{color:props.color}}>click me </button>
        )
}

//App.jsx
import Button from './Button.jsx'
function App() {
   return (
      <div>
             <Button   color="red"/>
            <Button   color="green"/>
      </div>
   )
}
props is a object that contains values that are passed to the component in key value pair
